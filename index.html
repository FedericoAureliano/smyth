          programs in a typed, functional language by gathering information from

          Let&rsquo;s see how
          <span class="system">Smyth</span>
          can help us finish a program that duplicates each element of a list.

        <p>
          We&rsquo;ve filled out the types and some unit tests here, but the actual
          implementation is incomplete.
          Click the &ldquo;Forge&rdquo; button to have
          <span class="system">Smyth</span>
          forge some code for us.

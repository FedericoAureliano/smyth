Differences (in blue) between results from submission and now:

\experimentCaptionSize
%
\\[3pt]
%
\textbf{2a: bool\_neg:} The \snsMyth{} expert examples include all of the
\myth{} expert examples, so this experiment should have been marked ``---''.
%
\\[3pt]
%
\textbf{2a: bool\_xor:} The \snsMyth{} expert examples changed and now include
all of the \myth{} expert examples, so this task is no longer applicable
(``---'').
%
\\[3pt]
%
\textbf{2a: list\_even\_parity:} This is now considered a failure in Experiment
1, so this task is no longer applicable (``---'').
%
\\[3pt]
%
\textbf{Synquid:} In the submission, \synquidDatatypeAxioms{} and
\synquidNotTraceComplete{} were used to mark tasks that could not be run due to
a \synquid{} implementation issue that has since been fixed. As expected, some
of the \synquidDatatypeAxioms{} tasks now succeed (\leonquidCorrectNoPhantom{}),
some produce an incorrect solution (\leonquidIncorrect{}), and some terminate
with zero solutions or do not find a solution within a timeout
(\leonquidError{}). Also as expected, all of the \synquidNotTraceComplete{}
tasks---where the examples are not trace-complete, i.e., do not form an
inductive- specification---fail (\leonquidIncorrect{} or \leonquidError{}).

%
\textbf{h-o examples:} TODO.

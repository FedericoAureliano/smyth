Differences (in blue) between results from \snsMyth{} at submission and
\snsMyth{} now:

\experimentCaptionSize
%
\\[3pt]
%
\textbf{list\_compress, tree\_binsert, tree\_nodes\_at\_level:} Not
automatically run by our scripts because they {\scriptsize{timeout}}.
%
\\[3pt]
%
\textbf{Expert: list\_even\_parity:} \snsMyth{} now finds a smaller solution
that is consistent with the \myth{} examples. We are not sure why \myth{} did
not also find that solution (which would have meant that they would have added
more examples until the desired solution was synthesized). We will mark this as
{\scriptsize{overspec}}.
%
\\[3pt]
%
\textbf{Expert: list\_filter:} We noticed that, given the \myth{} expert
examples, the term synthesized by \myth{} (Osera's thesis [35], p.171) is not
actually a correct implementation of the list filter function. We added
trace-complete examples until \snsMyth{} synthesizes a correct solution; there
are now 9 examples instead of the 8 reported in [35]. This approach is a proxy
for what the \myth{} developers might have done to obtain their expert set of
examples. (We did not contact the \myth{} developers nor try \myth{} given these
new examples.)
%

%
\textbf{Time:} Small variations in running time are expected. Two benchmarks
(list\_pairwise\_swap, list\_sorted\_insert) are now significantly faster due to
the improvements in search order.

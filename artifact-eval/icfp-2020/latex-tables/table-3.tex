\textbf{Benchmarks with dashes ({---})} in Figure 10 are not included in this
experiment either because they are not recursive or because they failed in
Experiment 1.

\textbf{Expert: list\_nth:} TODO probably mistake

\textbf{Expert: list\_snoc:} TODO probably mistake

\textbf{Expert: list\_even\_parity:} As in Experiment 1, \snsMyth{} now finds a
smaller solution, so we will mark this as {\scriptsize{overspec}}. (The desired
solution is ranked second by \snsMyth{}.)

\\[3pt]
%
\textbf{Expert: list\_filter:} TODO should go away again. staging parameters.
%
\\[3pt]
%
\textbf{Expert: list\_sorted\_insert:} This task succeeds now because of the
newly added responsive staging parameters.
%

%
%\textbf{Expert:} list\_pairwise\_swap: staging params helped, but still get
%overspec
%
\\[3pt]
%
\textbf{Expert: list\_concat:} The first solution now returned by \snsMyth{} is
a ``rev\_concat'' function (a generalization of snoc) rather than the desired
concat function (a generalization of cons). The second solution returned by
\snsMyth{} is the desired concat. Both of these solutions have the same AST
size, and so \snsMyth{} arbitrarily chooses. The \myth{} expert examples do not
distinguish between these two functions. Nevertheless, we will mark this as
{\scriptsize{incorrect}}.
%
\\[3pt]
%
\textbf{Random:} Small variations in k50 and k90 are expected because the
examples are generated randomly. There are some blue dots and a ``(---,---)''
because the provided scripts do not automatically display all the labels in
Figure 10.
